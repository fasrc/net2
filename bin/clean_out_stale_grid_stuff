NAME
    clean_out_stale_grid_stuff - clean out cruft left from grid jobs

SYNOPSIS
    clean_out_stale_grid_stuff

DESCRIPTION
    Run as a daily cron job.

    Here's some example output, showing what it works on:
      
      Sun Apr 11 15:49:44 EDT 2010: working on /opt/osg/globus/tmp/gram_job_state
      Sun Apr 11 15:49:44 EDT 2010: working on /opt/osg/globus/tmp/gram_job_state (second pass for consistency)
      Sun Apr 11 15:49:44 EDT 2010: working on /odyssey/home/usatlas1/.globus/job
      Sun Apr 11 15:49:44 EDT 2010: working on /odyssey/home/usatlas1/.globus/.gass_cache
      Sun Apr 11 15:49:48 EDT 2010: working on /odyssey/home/usatlas1/gram_job_mgr_*.log /odyssey/home/usatlas1/gram_scratch_*
      Sun Apr 11 15:49:48 EDT 2010: working on /odyssey/home/usatlas1/core.*

    It may complain about files that disappear while it's working on them; 
    that's not a problem.

    Run as a daily cron job.

    The script assumes there are no spaces in any file or directory names.
